1. In React we have to manage fronend and backend separatly
2. In React we have to use extenal library to manage route (react-router-dom)
3. React in not SEO optimised.
  -uses single html page and inject using js
  -browser uses crawlers, which extract data from html
  -based on the data browsers render and rank your website
4. Waterfall problem.
  -one after one steps
  -html -> script page -> css page -> authentication check -> etc.
  -this makes the process slow
  -req after req is not good.


NextJS resolves these issues...

-server side rendering - gets seo optimised
-api routes - single code base for frontend and backend
-filed based routing
-bundle size optimisation, static site generation
-maintained by vercel

-can't be distributed via a CDN
